## Usage Notes

### Phase 1: Base Composition
Use the `base_scene`, `camera`, `subject`, and `composition` fields for generating the core image structure.

### Phase 2: Environment Customization
The `environment` section adds realism and variety:
- **home_type**: Defines the socioeconomic context (middle-class, upscale, working-class, etc.)
- **room_style**: Specific design elements of the space (cabinets, furniture, fixtures, finishes)
- **lived_in_details**: Small objects that make spaces feel real (dishes, mail, artwork, toys)
- **atmosphere**: The overall mood and feeling of the home

### Phase 3: Brand Personalization
The `branding` section is always included and references the user's brand sheet:
- Attach the brand reference sheet as an image reference
- The prompt instructs the model to use uniform colors and styling from that sheet
